"""The `calibrate` command, the record store, and staleness detection.

The load-bearing test in this file is `test_editing_the_rubric_invalidates_the_record`.
Rubric drift is the failure mode that silently redefines a metric: change the wording and
the "regression" you see next week is a changed ruler, not a changed system. Everything
else here is scaffolding for that property.
