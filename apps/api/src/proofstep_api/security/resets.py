"""Password reset tokens, and the one route by which they leave this process.

Delivery is a seam with a single implementation, and that is a deliberate stopping point rather
than an unfinished one. There is no mail transport in this system yet — no SMTP, no provider — and
the wrong way to cope with that is to return the reset link in the HTTP response so the page can
show it. That turns "I forgot my password" into "type any address, receive an account". It is the
single most tempting shortcut in this whole flow and it hands over every account in the database.

So the token goes to the application log, at WARNING, marked for what it is. That is not a good
password-reset experience; it is an honest one. Whoever runs the installation can read it and pass
it on, which is a manual step with an audit trail, and `scripts/reset_link.py` exists so they can
mint one directly without the user having to ask through a form. When a mailer arrives, it
implements `deliver` and nothing else in the codebase changes.

The token itself is a URL-safe 256-bit random string, hashed with SHA-256 before it touches the
database — same construction as a refresh token and an invitation, for the same reason. Not Argon2,
which is for low-entropy secrets a human chose; a 256-bit random value has nothing to brute-force
and a slow hash here would only slow the legitimate path.
