"""Sign-up, sign-in, and session lifetime.

Until now the only credential was a project API key created by a script, which is right for a
machine and impossible for a person: there was no way to become a user, so there was no way for a
team to share anything. This is the layer that turns a self-hosted service into a product someone
can sign up for.

Four decisions, each of which shapes what an attacker can do:

**Sign-up creates an organization and a project, not just a user.** Landing in an empty account with
a "create your first workspace" screen is a step that exists only because the schema needed it.
Every real first action — send a trace, run a suite — needs a project, so sign-up makes one.

**Refresh tokens rotate, and reuse revokes the family.** Each refresh mints a new token and marks
the old one used. Presenting an already-used token means either a client bug or a stolen token, and
the two are indistinguishable from here — so the family is revoked and everyone re-authenticates.
Losing a session is a small cost; a silently cloned session is not.

**Login and sign-up are rate limited by address.** They are the only unauthenticated write paths in
the system, so they are where a password-guessing loop would live. `get_principal` limits everything
behind it, but these run before there is a principal to limit.

**The same answer for "no such user" and "wrong password".** Different messages turn the login form
into an account-enumeration oracle, which is how a credential-stuffing list gets refined.

# approximate timing. A different response for a known address turns this into a membership oracle
# against any email list.
#
# **Using a reset invalidates every session.** A password is reset either because it was forgotten
