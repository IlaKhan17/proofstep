"""Organizations, members, projects, and API keys — the self-service surface.

Everything here was previously a shell script an operator ran. That is the difference between a
service you host for yourself and a product other people use: a team has to be able to add a
colleague, create a project, and mint a key for their CI without anyone opening a terminal on the
server.

The shape of authorisation here, because it is easy to get subtly wrong:

- **Membership is on the organization, not the project.** A person joins an org with a role, and
  that role applies to every project in it. Per-project roles are a real need eventually, and
  deliberately not now — the schema supports adding them without a migration to memberships, and
  inventing them early would double the number of places an access check has to be right.
- **The role gate is `Permission.MEMBERS_MANAGE` / `KEYS_MANAGE`, not "is admin".** Roles map to
  permissions in one table (`security/permissions.py`); checking the permission means a future role
  slots in without revisiting every route.
- **Cross-organization access is 404, never 403.** A 403 confirms the organization exists, which
  turns an unguessable id into a confirmed one. Same rule the project routes already follow.

Invitations are by email and expire. They carry a single-use token that is *hashed* at rest, for the
same reason API keys are: an invitation link is a credential that grants membership, and a leaked
database should not hand out organization access.
