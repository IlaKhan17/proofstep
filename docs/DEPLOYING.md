# Deploying Proofstep

Three ways to run it, in order of how much of it you want to operate yourself.

| | You run | Good for |
|---|---|---|
| [Docker Compose](#docker-compose) | one host, everything on it | trying it out, small teams, a single-tenant install |
| [Kubernetes](#kubernetes) | the app; managed Postgres, Redis, object storage | anything with a platform team |
| [The live instance](https://proofstep.ilarehman.com) | nothing | trying it before running anything |

There is a live instance at **[proofstep.ilarehman.com](https://proofstep.ilarehman.com)**, with its
API at `https://api.proofstep.ilarehman.com`. Sign up and point an SDK at it to see the loop work
without deploying anything. It is one small instance run by the author — no uptime commitment, no
retention promise — so treat it as a demonstration rather than somewhere to keep data.

The images are `ghcr.io/ilakhan17/proofstep/api` and `ghcr.io/ilakhan17/proofstep/web`, built for
amd64 and arm64. Tags: a version (`0.1.0`), a minor series (`0.1`), or `edge` for the tip of main.
Pin a version. A `latest` tag exists — `docker/metadata-action` adds one for semver releases — but
tracking it means a restart can change the code without a deploy, which turns a rollback into
archaeology.

Every image carries a build provenance attestation, so you can check where it came from before you
run it:

```bash
gh attestation verify --owner IlaKhan17 oci://ghcr.io/ilakhan17/proofstep/api:0.1.0
```

## Docker Compose

```bash
git clone https://github.com/IlaKhan17/proofstep && cd proofstep
./scripts/init_secrets.sh          # writes secrets/ and .env.prod
$EDITOR .env.prod                  # at minimum: PROOFSTEP_TAG, WEB_PORT, FORWARDED_ALLOW_IPS
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml --env-file .env.prod up -d
./scripts/smoke_stack.sh http://127.0.0.1:3000
```

`smoke_stack.sh` signs up, mints a key, sends a trace, and reads it back. It is worth running: it
takes four requests to cross every part of the system, and each container bug this project has hit
so far was invisible to the test suite and obvious to that script.

**Secrets are files, not environment variables.** An environment variable is readable from
`/proc/<pid>/environ`, appears in `docker inspect`, and lands in crash reports. `init_secrets.sh`
writes `secrets/` at mode 600 and never overwrites — regenerating `jwt_secret` signs everyone out,
and regenerating a database password locks the application out of its own data until the role is
altered to match.

### Public HTTPS

`docker-compose.tls.yml` puts Caddy in front of both services and gets Let's Encrypt certificates
that renew themselves:

```bash
# in .env.prod
PROOFSTEP_DOMAIN=proofstep.example.com
PROOFSTEP_API_DOMAIN=api.proofstep.example.com
ACME_EMAIL=you@example.com
DASHBOARD_URL=https://proofstep.example.com
CORS_ORIGINS=https://proofstep.example.com
FORWARDED_ALLOW_IPS=172.16.0.0/12

docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml -f docker-compose.tls.yml --env-file .env.prod up -d
```

Both hostnames need an A record pointing at the host, and **ports 80 and 443 must be reachable from
the internet before you start it**. Port 80 is not a redirect convenience — Let's Encrypt's HTTP-01
challenge is served on it, so blocking it means no certificate is issued and the site never comes
up at all.

Two hostnames, not one with a path prefix. A browser reaching the dashboard carries a session
cookie; an SDK reaching the API carries a key. Serving both from one origin means the browser
attaches that cookie to SDK-shaped requests because the origin matches, and the separation the
dashboard's proxy allow-list enforces is one misconfigured route from gone.

With this overlay the dashboard is no longer published directly on a host port — Caddy reaches it
over the compose network. A published port alongside TLS is a second, plaintext way in.

### Without TLS

**The API is not published to the host.** The dashboard reaches it over the compose network. But
SDKs have to reach it from wherever your instrumented application runs, so a deployment without the
TLS overlay has to publish it somehow — behind your own proxy, or with:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml -f docker-compose.expose-api.yml \
  --env-file .env.prod up -d
```

That binds to loopback by default. `API_BIND=0.0.0.0` only when something in front of this host is
terminating TLS: API keys travel in the `Authorization` header, and plaintext HTTP is how they end
up in somebody else's logs.

### What runs where

```
web    (dashboard)     → api over the compose network, carrying the caller's session
api    (HTTP)          → postgres as the *application* role, redis, object storage
worker (background)    → the same, plus the owning role for its two DDL jobs
migrate (runs once)    → the owning role: alembic, then the application role's grants
```

`migrate` is a separate service that must complete before `api` and `worker` start. Migrations do
not run on boot: three replicas racing the same DDL is a deadlock waiting for a slow morning, and a
role that can create a table can create one with no row-level-security policy.

## Kubernetes

See [`infra/k8s/README.md`](../infra/k8s/README.md). Kustomize, no Helm — it is ten resources, and a
chart's templating language is a second thing to debug when the first thing is already YAML.

```bash
kubectl create namespace proofstep
kubectl -n proofstep create secret generic proofstep-secrets \
  --from-literal=jwt-secret="$(openssl rand -hex 32)" \
  --from-literal=database-url='postgresql+psycopg://proofstep_app:...@HOST:5432/proofstep' \
  --from-literal=migration-database-url='postgresql+psycopg://proofstep:...@HOST:5432/proofstep' \
  --from-literal=s3-secret-key='...'
kubectl apply -k infra/k8s
```

Postgres, Redis, and object storage are not included, on purpose. They are the stateful parts, they
are the parts whose loss is unrecoverable, and manifests that looked production-ready without being
so would be worse than their absence.

## Before you call it production

The full list is [`docs/HARDENING.md`](HARDENING.md). The four that actually bite:

1. **The application must not own its tables.** Both deployment paths handle this — `migrate` runs
   as the owner and provisions a separate application role — but verify it rather than assume:

   ```bash
   curl -s https://api.example.com/readyz
   {"status": "ready", "checks": {"row_level_security": "enforced (26/26 tables)"}}
   ```

   If that says `not_enforced`, every row-level-security policy in the database exists and does
   nothing, and nothing else in the system's behaviour will tell you.

2. **TLS, in front of everything.** `docker-compose.tls.yml` does this; the Kubernetes manifests
   leave it to your ingress controller.

3. **`FORWARDED_ALLOW_IPS`, narrowed to your proxy.** Left wide, `X-Forwarded-For` is
   caller-controlled and every client address in the audit log is whatever the caller claimed.

4. **Backups you have restored from.** `scripts/backup.sh` and `scripts/restore.sh` exist;
   a backup nobody has restored is a hypothesis.
