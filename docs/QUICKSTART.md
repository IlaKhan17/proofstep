# Quickstart

Fifteen minutes, from a clone to a failing CI gate you caused on purpose. Everything below runs
offline — no provider key, no account, no network calls to anything but your own containers.

You need [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), Docker, and (for the dashboard) Node with
[pnpm](https://pnpm.io/).

---

## 1. The whole thing, in one command (3 min)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/IlaKhan17/proofstep && cd proofstep
make setup            # python toolchain + workspace
make web-install      # dashboard dependencies (skip if you don't want the UI)
./scripts/demo.sh
```

`demo.sh` starts Postgres, Redis, and MinIO; applies migrations; creates a project and an API key;
boots the API; seeds 60 Davis-shaped traces of which 9 violate a trajectory policy; registers the
policy, a review queue, and an online rule; runs the rule so the queue is populated; and starts the
dashboard. Ports are probed, so it will not collide with whatever else you have on 8000 and 3000.

It prints where everything is:

```
  dashboard   http://127.0.0.1:3010/traces
  API docs    http://127.0.0.1:8010/docs
  API key     ps_dev_...
```

It also prints a warning you should read once:

```
! row-level security is not in effect (the demo role is a superuser).
```

That is honest rather than broken — RLS is installed, and a superuser is exempt from every policy
regardless. For anything real, `docs/HARDENING.md` is one script and two environment variables.

**Open the dashboard.** Click a trace whose `scenario` metadata says `violating`. The waterfall shows
`gmail.send` with no `approval_received` before it and no `guardrail.injection_scan` at all. The
email in that trace is fine. The behaviour is not — and that difference is the entire premise.

---

## 2. Run an evaluation suite locally (2 min)

No server involved in this step. The CLI runs the same evaluation code the API does.

```bash
uv run proofstep eval evals/suites/davis-agent-policy.yaml
```

You get a per-metric table, gate results, and exit code 0. Now break the agent the way a bad refactor
would:

```bash
DAVIS_BREAK_POLICY=1 uv run proofstep eval evals/suites/davis-agent-policy.yaml
echo $?    # 1
```

The agent still produces a perfectly good email. The gate fails anyway:

```
agent_policy_compliance            —           0          —  ✗  min 1

1 blocking failure

✗ agent_policy_compliance  agent_policy_compliance 0 < minimum 1
```

Which rule, in which span, is in the JSON report the run writes
(`proofstep-davis-agent-policy.json`) — every violation names its offending span id and event index.
The same attribution is what the PR comment renders, and `proofstep policy-check <policy> <trace>`
prints it for a single trace while you are writing the policy.

That non-zero exit is the whole product. Everything else — the dashboard, the queues, the online
rules — exists to feed it.

Other suites worth a look, all offline:

```bash
uv run proofstep eval evals/suites/davis-email.yaml         # judges, via a deterministic stub
uv run proofstep eval evals/suites/quiz-learning.yaml       # AUC/Brier — no judge, on purpose
uv run proofstep eval evals/suites/quiz-security.yaml       # cross-tenant leakage as an eval
```

`evals/suites/davis-email.yaml` uses a judge. It runs with no API key because
`examples/stub_judge.py` stands in for the model — it exercises the whole judge machinery
(structured output, canary check, input allow-list, cost accounting, self-consistency voting) and
answers from fixture markers rather than from the rubric. Swap in a real client with one flag:

```bash
uv run proofstep eval evals/suites/davis-email.yaml --model-client myproject.models:make_client
```

---

## 3. Instrument your own agent (5 min)

```bash
uv add proofstep      # from this checkout: uv pip install -e packages/python-sdk
```

```python
import proofstep

proofstep.init(
    endpoint="http://127.0.0.1:8010",
    api_key="ps_dev_...",       # the key demo.sh printed
    environment="production",
)

async def handle(prospect_id: str) -> dict:
    with proofstep.capture("outbound") as captured:
        # State a policy can read. A rule cannot check what the trace does not carry.
        proofstep.set_state(unsubscribed=False)

        with proofstep.start_span("draft", span_type="llm") as span:
            span.set_output({"subject": "..."})

        with proofstep.start_span("gmail.send", span_type="tool", tool_name="gmail.send") as span:
            span.set_args({"to": "buyer@example.com", "thread_id": "t-1"})

    return {"trace": captured[0].trace_id}
```

Three things are worth knowing before you wire this into anything real:

- **Arguments are what policies read.** `set_args` is not decoration: `argument_condition` and
  `unique_action` rules match on `args.*`, so a check whose result never reaches the trace is
  unauditable.
- **Redaction happens in the SDK, before export.** Access tokens, refresh tokens, API keys,
  passwords, session cookies, and `Authorization` headers are never intentionally stored, and the
  server re-scrubs as a backstop. See `docs/SECURITY.md`.
- **Sampling is per-rule and deterministic** (SHA-256 of the trace id, salted per rule), so two 1%
  rules do not both select the same 1%.

Your traces appear in the dashboard immediately. Nothing else is required to start.

## 4. Write a policy for your agent (3 min)

A policy is reviewable YAML — the point is that it shows up in a PR diff, not in a config UI:

```yaml
apiVersion: proofstep.dev/v1
kind: TrajectoryPolicy
name: my-agent
aliases:
  gmail.send: [send_email]          # a rename must not silently disable a rule

rules:
  - id: no-send-before-approval
    kind: forbidden_before
    severity: block
    action: gmail.send
    before: approval_received
    message: An email was sent before human approval was received.

  - id: no-duplicate-send
    kind: unique_action
    severity: block
    action: gmail.send
    key: [args.to, args.thread_id]

  - id: search-budget
    kind: limit
    severity: warn                  # cost, not safety — see below
    action: web_search
    max_calls: 8
```

Check it without running anything:

```bash
uv run proofstep policy-check my-policy.yaml
```

`severity: warn` for the budget rule is deliberate. A search overrun costs money; sending without
approval is a safety failure. Blocking a merge on the first trains people to bypass the gate that
also carries the second. `evals/policies/davis-agent-policy.yaml` is a worked 13-rule example with
the reasoning inline.

---

## 5. Put it in CI (2 min)

```yaml
# .github/workflows/eval.yml
name: eval
on: pull_request

jobs:
  eval:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: read
      pull-requests: write        # required for the comment; without it the run still gates
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: IlaKhan17/proofstep/.github/actions/proofstep@v0.1.0
        with:
          suite: evals/suites/my-agent.yaml
```

The baseline for regression gates is declared in the suite, not on the command line — it belongs
with the gates it feeds, and a baseline that can be changed per invocation is a gate that can be
argued with:

```yaml
baseline:
  strategy: latest_on_branch
  branch: main
```

Set `PROOFSTEP_ENDPOINT` and `PROOFSTEP_API_KEY` in the job and each run is **recorded on the
server**: the dataset it ran against, every score, the gate verdict, and the commit. The baseline is
pulled from there before the run, so "did my branch make it worse than main?" is answered by the
same process that produces the exit code.

Publishing never changes that exit code — a server outage cannot turn a failing run into a passing
one — and a failed publish prints to stderr rather than passing silently. `--local` opts out
entirely; `--require-publish` makes a missing record a failure for teams whose process depends on
it.

Introducing it to an existing repository? `fail-on-gate: "false"` makes the run advisory — you get
the report and the comment without blocking anyone until the numbers are trusted.

The action posts one updating comment per PR, fails on a blocking gate, and is safe on fork PRs —
where there are no secrets by design, deterministic and trajectory evaluators still run and judges
are skipped rather than silently passed. `docs/GITHUB_ACTIONS.md` covers exit codes and the
fork-safety rules.

## Troubleshooting

**`docker info` fails** — Docker Desktop is not running. Everything else depends on it.

**Ports in use** — `demo.sh` probes 8000/3000 and falls back to 8010/3010. Pin with
`API_PORT=9000 WEB_PORT=4000 ./scripts/demo.sh`. Service ports come from `.env`, generated by
`scripts/gen-dev-env.sh`, which probes too.

**The dashboard is empty** — check the API key in `apps/web/.env.local`. `demo.sh` writes it,
pointing at the port it actually used. The key is read server-side and proxied, never shipped to the
browser (`apps/web/src/lib/proxy-policy.ts`).

**A suite fails on a fresh clone** — regenerate the fixtures:
`uv run python scripts/gen_reference_fixtures.py`.

**`proofstep eval` refuses to start** — a suite with judges needs `--model-client`. It refuses up
front rather than failing halfway through a paid run.

**"not published · PROOFSTEP_ENDPOINT and PROOFSTEP_API_KEY are not both set"** — expected on a
laptop with no server. Runs still gate on their absolute floors; only the record and the baseline
comparison are skipped.
