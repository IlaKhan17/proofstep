# Operations

Running Proofstep somewhere real. `HARDENING.md` explains *why* the isolation model is what it is;
this is the procedure, plus the two things that only exist in an operator's world — backups and
alerts.

Everything here has been executed against a running system. Where something has **not** been
exercised, it says so rather than reading like a completed step.

---

## 1. Roles: the application must not own its tables

The single most important deployment step, and the easiest to skip because skipping it changes
nothing observable. Row-level security applies to neither a superuser nor a table's owner (unless
every policy carries `FORCE`, which a future migration can silently drop). Connect as a role that is
neither, and tenant isolation has three layers instead of one.

```bash
# once, as an owning or superuser role, after migrations
psql -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 \
  -c "SET proofstep.role_password = '$(openssl rand -hex 24)'" \
  -f scripts/create_app_role.sql
```

The container images do this as the second half of their `migrate` command, so a compose or
Kubernetes deployment gets it without a manual step. See `scripts/provision_app_role.py`.

Then two roles in the environment:

```bash
# the application: no DDL, no ownership, subject to every policy
POSTGRES_USER=proofstep_app
POSTGRES_PASSWORD_FILE=/run/secrets/db-password

# migrations and the worker's DDL jobs: owns the schema
MIGRATION_DATABASE_URL=postgresql+psycopg://proofstep:...@db:5432/proofstep
```

`MIGRATION_DATABASE_URL` is used by Alembic and by the worker's two DDL jobs (partition maintenance
and retention). Everything else uses the application role. **In production the API refuses to start**
when its role bypasses RLS; `ALLOW_RLS_BYPASS=1` is the deliberate escape hatch, and it warns on
every boot so it cannot be set once and forgotten.

Verify:

```bash
uv run python scripts/preflight.py     # exits non-zero on a blocking problem
curl -s localhost:8000/readyz | jq .checks.row_level_security
# "enforced (26/26 tables)"
```

**Verified.** The full stack — ingest, online evaluation, review queues, CLI publishing, and the
worker — has been run end to end as `proofstep_app` with 26/26 tables enforced.

---

## 2. Secrets and keys

### Secrets from files, not environment variables

Every sensitive setting accepts a `<NAME>_FILE` variant pointing at a file: `JWT_SECRET_FILE`,
`POSTGRES_PASSWORD_FILE`, `S3_SECRET_KEY_FILE`, `DATABASE_URL_FILE`, `MIGRATION_DATABASE_URL_FILE`.
This is the convention Docker secrets and Kubernetes secret volumes already speak, and it matters
because an environment variable is readable from `/proc/<pid>/environ`, appears in `docker inspect`,
and lands in crash reports. A file has an owner and a mode.

An empty file is treated as absent — "the orchestrator has not populated this yet" produces a
clearer failure than "your signing key is the empty string".

### API keys

`scripts/manage_keys.py` works in production (`bootstrap_dev.py` deliberately does not):

```bash
uv run python scripts/manage_keys.py list   --project acme
uv run python scripts/manage_keys.py create --project acme --name ci --scopes ingest read --expires-days 90
uv run python scripts/manage_keys.py rotate --prefix ps_prod_ab12cd34 --grace-hours 24
uv run python scripts/manage_keys.py revoke --prefix ps_prod_ab12cd34 --reason "rotated"
```

Rotation is **overlap, not replacement**: the new key is minted and the old one is given an expiry
rather than being revoked on the spot, because a rotation that breaks every running job the moment
it happens is a rotation nobody performs. Update the consumers, then revoke.

Revocation takes effect within `API_KEY_CACHE_TTL_S` (30s default) — worth knowing before the
half-minute where a revoked key still works becomes alarming.

Every action is written to `audit_logs`. `preflight.py` fails when a development-issued key
(`ps_dev_*`, `ps_test_*`) is still live in production, which is the normal residue of a database
promoted from a development install.

**Verified.** Create → 200, rotate → both keys valid during the grace window, revoke → 401 after the
cache expires.

### TLS and proxies

Not handled by the application, deliberately: terminate TLS at your ingress. Two things to configure
there, because they are wrong by default —

- Run uvicorn with `--proxy-headers --forwarded-allow-ips=<your proxy>` so client IPs in audit logs
  are real. Without the allow-list, `X-Forwarded-For` is attacker-controlled.
- Add HSTS at the proxy. The app sets `X-Content-Type-Options`, `X-Frame-Options`, `Referrer-Policy`,
  and `Permissions-Policy`, but a service that cannot see its own scheme should not be asserting
  transport policy.

**Not exercised.** Nothing here has run behind a real proxy.

---

## 3. Backups

```bash
./scripts/backup.sh                                     # → backups/proofstep-<ts>.dump + manifest
./scripts/restore.sh backups/<file>.dump --into proofstep_restore_check
```

The backup writes a manifest beside the dump: sha256, schema version, tenant-policy count, and row
counts for ten tables. The restore verifies against it and **refuses to report success on a
mismatch**. That is the whole point — anyone can run `pg_restore`; what fails in an incident is
discovering afterwards that the dump was truncated or came from a different schema version.

`restore.sh` refuses to overwrite a non-empty database without `--force`.

**Verified.** A full drill has been run: backup → restore into a scratch database → all ten row
counts, the schema version, and all 41 policies match → `preflight.py` passes against the restored
database.

### What this does not cover

- **Point-in-time recovery.** These are logical snapshots; everything written between two runs is
  lost if the primary is. PITR needs continuous WAL archiving, which is Postgres configuration
  rather than a script: set `archive_mode = on`, an `archive_command` that ships to durable storage,
  and `wal_level = replica`. **Not configured here, and not exercised.**
- **Payloads in object storage.** Large span payloads live in S3/MinIO with their own lifecycle. The
  manifest says so rather than letting a complete-looking dump imply otherwise. Use bucket
  versioning and replication.
- **A restore rehearsal on production-sized data.** The drill above ran against ~34k spans. Restore
  time is not linear in a way you want to discover during an incident.

### Schedule

Daily is the usual answer; the right one depends on how much evaluation history you can afford to
lose. Run `backup.sh` from cron or a Kubernetes CronJob, ship the output off-host, and **restore
from it periodically** — an untested backup is not a backup, and the verification in `restore.sh`
exists so that test is one command.

## 4. Monitoring and alerts

`GET /metrics` exposes Prometheus text. It requires a bearer token with the `read` scope —
Prometheus supports `authorization.credentials_file`, so this is one line of scrape config, and it
avoids adding an unauthenticated surface to a service whose threat model is about who may read what.

`infra/alerts/proofstep.rules.yml` has nine rules, each for a failure that is otherwise **silent**:

| Alert | Fires when | Why it is not obvious |
|---|---|---|
| `ProofstepWorkerStopped` | no heartbeat for 5 min | the API stays healthy; only new data stops appearing |
| `ProofstepNoWorkerRegistered` | no worker ever beat | a deployment with no worker looks perfect from outside |
| `ProofstepQueueUnreachable` | Redis unreadable | depth 0 and "cannot see it" look identical in a number |
| `ProofstepQueueBacklog` | >100 ready jobs for 15 min | deferred cron jobs are excluded, or it fires constantly |
| `ProofstepDeadLetters` | any unresolved failure | arq drops a job after its retries, silently |
| `ProofstepDeadLettersUnattended` | oldest >3 days | nobody is reading the first alert |
| `ProofstepReviewQueueStale` | oldest pending >7 days | a queue nobody reads still looks like a control |
| `ProofstepTenantIsolationNotEnforced` | `rls_enforced == 0` | behaviour is identical either way |
| `ProofstepDown` | scrape fails | |

Worker liveness comes from a heartbeat row written every minute by a dedicated cron job **and** after
every job. A row rather than a Redis key with a TTL: when Redis is what broke, a TTL-based signal
disappears exactly when it is needed, and "the worker is down" becomes indistinguishable from "I
cannot tell".

**Verified.** Metrics scraped from a live API; heartbeats appear within a minute of the worker
starting and the gauge reports their age.

**Not exercised.** No alert has actually fired into a pager — the rules are written and parse, but
routing, inhibition, and on-call escalation are yours.

---

## 5. Rate limits

Enforced per **validated** credential, in a one-minute fixed window backed by Redis:

```bash
RATE_LIMIT_INGEST_PER_MIN=600   # /v1/ingest, /v1/otlp
RATE_LIMIT_READ_PER_MIN=300     # GET
RATE_LIMIT_WRITE_PER_MIN=60     # everything else
RATE_LIMIT_AUTH_PER_MIN=10      # failed authentication, per client address
```

Set any to `0` to disable that class. Every response carries `X-RateLimit-Limit`, `-Remaining`, and
`-Reset`; a 429 adds `Retry-After`. Ingestion has its own budget so a busy exporter cannot starve
the reads a dashboard needs.

Three behaviours worth knowing before an incident:

- **Failed authentication is counted against the caller's address**, not the credential it claimed.
  Otherwise anyone could exhaust another tenant's budget by sending its key prefix with a wrong
  secret. This is also what makes guessing a key expensive.
- **It fails open.** When Redis is unreachable, requests are allowed and
  `proofstep_rate_limiter_available` goes to 0. A limiter that takes the API down when its own
  dependency blips causes a worse outage than the abuse it prevents — but "not limiting" must not
  look like "no traffic", hence the gauge.
- **`/metrics`, `/healthz`, and `/readyz` are exempt.** Throttling your own observability during a
  load spike is exactly backwards.

Behind a proxy, run uvicorn with `--proxy-headers --forwarded-allow-ips=<proxy>` or every client
shares one address bucket.

**Verified.** Live against Redis: the sixth request over a limit of five returns 429 with
`Retry-After`, and `/metrics` still scrapes while a tenant is throttled.

---

## 6. Spend ceiling

A suite's `max_cost` stops one run. This stops the month:

```bash
curl -XPUT $API/v1/ops/budget -H "authorization: Bearer $KEY" \
     -d '{"monthly_limit": 250}'          # null clears it; 0 means "free rules only"
curl $API/v1/ops/budget -H "authorization: Bearer $KEY"
```

**It covers server-initiated spend only** — the online-evaluation loop. A judge the CLI calls runs
in your own process against your own provider account; the server records what it is told and cannot
refuse it. That scope is stated in the response body too, because a limit whose coverage is assumed
is worse than one whose coverage is written down.

When the ceiling is reached, **paid rules stop and free ones keep running**. A deterministic
trajectory policy costs nothing per trace, and switching off the safety checks because the judge
allowance ran out would trade a bill for an incident. Every skipped evaluation is recorded with
`decision_reason = 'budget'`, so a coverage gap is a queryable reason rather than an absence.

Watch `proofstep_project_spend_ratio` and `proofstep_project_budget_exhausted`; two alert rules
cover the 80% mark and exhaustion. Setting the ceiling needs a configuration scope, not read —
raising it is how a bill gets bigger.

## 7. Accounts: invitations and forgotten passwords

Both flows work with or without a mail server. Without one, they need an operator in the loop, and
it is worth knowing which parts. With one, they are self-service.

### Configuring email

Optional, and off by default. Set `SMTP_HOST` and the two flows below start sending real messages;
leave it unset and they behave exactly as described further down. The API reports which mode it is
in at startup, so this is not something you discover when an invitation goes nowhere.

```bash
SMTP_HOST=smtp.resend.com     # or smtp.postmarkapp.com, email-smtp.<region>.amazonaws.com, ...
SMTP_PORT=587                 # 587 = STARTTLS (usual); 465 = implicit TLS, also set SMTP_TLS=true
SMTP_USERNAME=resend
EMAIL_FROM="Proofstep <no-reply@yourdomain.com>"
echo -n "your-relay-password" > secrets/smtp_password   # never an env var; see §2
```

SMTP rather than a provider SDK, so any relay works and choosing a vendor is not a code change —
including a local postfix, where `SMTP_USERNAME` and the password can both be empty.

**`EMAIL_FROM`'s domain must be one your relay is authorised to send for.** SPF and DKIM are checked
against it, and a mismatch is the usual reason mail is accepted by the relay and then silently
filed as spam by the recipient. Verify the domain with your provider before assuming delivery is
broken for some subtler reason.

**Sending never fails the request that triggered it.** A relay that is down does not refuse an
invitation or tell someone their reset did not happen — the row is written and the link is valid,
so the honest outcome is "it exists, the mail is late". Failures are logged with the recipient and
subject.

**Set `DASHBOARD_URL`.** Reset links are built from it. It is configuration rather than something
read from the request, because a link built from a caller-supplied `Host` header points wherever the
caller said — with a live token attached. Wrong value, dead links.

### Invitations

An admin invites an address in **Settings → Members**. The dashboard always shows the link, and
when a relay is configured the invitation is emailed as well — both, because "copy the link and
send it over Slack" is how a lot of teams actually onboard, and that path should not stop working
just because email started. The link:

- works only for the address it was issued to, so forwarding it does not transfer membership;
- expires in 14 days, and can be accepted once;
- is stored only as a SHA-256 digest, so it cannot be recovered from the database — a lost link is
  reissued, not looked up.

Someone with no account who follows it signs up *into* the inviting organization rather than getting
a personal workspace of their own first.

### Forgotten passwords

`/forgot` on the dashboard creates a reset token. **With `SMTP_HOST` set, the link is emailed** and
is deliberately *not* written to the log: once it has reached the person it was for, logging it too
would put every account one log query away from takeover. The log records only that a message was
sent, and to which address.

With no mail transport configured, the link leaves the process by one route only — a `WARNING` in
the API log:

```
PASSWORD RESET LINK for someone@example.com (no mail transport is configured, ...): https://.../reset?token=...
```

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml --env-file .env.prod logs api | grep "PASSWORD RESET LINK"
```

Or skip the form entirely and issue one directly:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml --env-file .env.prod exec api \
  python scripts/reset_link.py someone@example.com
```

Either way the link is valid once, for an hour (`PASSWORD_RESET_TTL_S`), and using it signs every
session on that account out — including an attacker's, which is the case worth designing for.

**The link is never returned in an HTTP response**, and that is the load-bearing decision in this
flow rather than an inconvenience to work around. An endpoint that handed the reset link back to
whoever asked for it would let anyone type any address and receive a working credential for that
account.

Mail is also sent *after* the response is written, not during it. `/forgot` answers identically for
an address that has an account and one that does not — that is what stops it being a membership
oracle — and an SMTP round trip on only one of those branches would hand the same oracle back to
anyone holding a stopwatch.

## Deploy sequence

```bash
uv run alembic upgrade head          # as the migration role
uv run python scripts/preflight.py   # blocks the deploy on a failed check
# start the API, start the worker, then route traffic
```

The worker is not optional. Without it there is no online evaluation, no review-queue escalation, no
lease recovery, and no retention — and, as above, nothing about the API's behaviour says so.

## Still open

Listed here rather than left to be discovered — `HARDENING.md §Not done` is the fuller list.

- **Load verification on reference hardware** (4 vCPU / 8 GiB), including query latency against a
  10M-span dataset. `tests/load/README.md` says what the committed numbers do and do not mean.
- **Rate limiting on ingest.** Settings exist; enforcement does not.
- **Deployment manifests.** No Kubernetes or systemd units ship here.
- **An org-level spend ceiling** for judge costs. Per-suite `max_cost` exists; nothing caps a month.
