# Two URLs, because the product has two front doors and they authenticate differently: a browser
# reaches the dashboard and rides a session cookie through its proxy, while an SDK reaches the API
# with a key. Testing only one of them leaves half the product unproven. The API argument is
# optional; without it the ingest half is skipped and says so.
#
# Sign up, mint a key, send a trace, read it back. Four requests, and between them they touch every
# piece of the system: the dashboard's proxy and its session cookies, the API's auth and its
# unprivileged database role, the ingest path, object storage, and every row-level-security policy
# on the way through.
#
# This exists because the container bugs found so far were all invisible to the test suite. A
# dependency that only the development environment installed. A settings guard that demanded a
# credential the process should not hold. An insert with no tenant set, which a superuser connection
# accepts and the production role refuses — so signup, the first request any new user makes, worked
# in development and returned a 500 in production. None of those are reachable from pytest, and all
# of them are reachable from four curl calls against the real thing.
#
# Safe to run against a fresh deployment. It creates one account, and says which one.
