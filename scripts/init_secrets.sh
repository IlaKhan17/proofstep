# cannot reference a file — so it has to appear in both places. Copying it by hand is a step that is
# easy to get subtly wrong (a trailing newline, the wrong file) and whose failure mode is an
# authentication error three services deep.
#
# Same rule as the secrets: never overwrite. This file accumulates real configuration.

Next:
  1. Review .env.prod — at minimum PROOFSTEP_TAG, WEB_PORT, and FORWARDED_ALLOW_IPS.
  2. docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml --env-file .env.prod up -d

Back these up somewhere you can reach when the host is gone. Losing jwt_secret signs everyone out;
losing app_db_password is recoverable with ALTER ROLE, but only if you can still reach the database.
